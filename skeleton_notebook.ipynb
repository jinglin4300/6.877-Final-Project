    "**Context**: After an important document from the Generic Space Empire (GSC) was stolen, Non-Copyrighted Alien spies began complex attacks against the prize of the GSC, the space station. These attacks are more complex than before, requiring a compromising of a combination of components, often distributed across workstations. In order to defend against these attacks, the GSC has hired our team to develop a methodology to characterize the faults found within the system after an attack. \n"
