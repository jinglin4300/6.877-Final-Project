    "**Context**: After an important document from the Generic Space Empire (GSC) was stolen, Non-Copyrighted Alien spies began complex attacks against the prize of the GSC, the space station. These attacks are more complex than before, requiring a compromising of a combination of components, often distributed across workstations. In order to defend against these attacks, the GSC has hired our team to develop a methodology to characterize the faults found within the system after an attack. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivation**: Mode is a term for behavior of a system. All components in a system have behaviors associated with modes, as well as modes that are unknown to the component. Mode estimation takes in the mode, state, and observable variables and tries to determine a diagnoses for what is causing the outcome state of the system. Mode estimation is a very useful tool for characterizing what has occurred in a system that could produce a given end state. \n"

    "Mode estimation will help us identify possible diagnoses for the system, but we still need to develop a model and a search mechanism for mode estimation to be performed on. We will formulate this problem as a search problem, with a constraint satisfaction problem model, which is described in greater detail below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model**: To build our model, we plan to use a constraint satisfaction problem model. Constrain Satisfaction Models are used to describe real world problems. Our model will represent an input state, which is based off a set of variable assignments, and a list of conditions for a state to be a solution. These conditions will be defined by using a set of constraints on the aforementioned variables. \n",

    "The constraints that we decide for our system will be vital in defining how the mode estimation will search for the required decisions, as well as how the search will be performed.\n",

    " - red circuits cannot exist in the same grouping as blue circuits\n",

    "A* is a best first search algorithm. With CBA*, A* is used to search over the decision variables. In our problem, decision varaibles are the components in the system, where the decision is what mode we assign to that component. An initial state has no assignment, and the goal state is a complete assignment of modes to all components. After full assignment of decision variables, we need to check to see if that is consistent with the state variables, i.e. the inputs and observations. \n",
    "With A* we need to identify the functions for f(x)=g(x)+h(x). g(x)could be product of probabilities of decision variables already assigned, while h(x) could be the highest-possible product of each of the remaining unassigned variables. h(x) thus defined is an admissible heurestic because it overestimate the probability. Luckily, we have the probability functions from the previous section to assist with this calculation. \n",

For example, even if one of the states at the higher depth levels contains a premise that is logically impossible, the children of that node will still be added to the queue and expanded. This creates additional expansions that are not needed. To address the issue of searching spaces that we don't need to, we can apply a pruning strategy to CBA* to imrpove the computational processing time.\n",
