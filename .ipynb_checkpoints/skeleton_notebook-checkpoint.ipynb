    "**Context**: After an important document from the Generic Space Empire (GSC) was stolen, Non-Copyrighted Alien spies began complex attacks against the prize of the GSC, the space station. These attacks are more complex than before, requiring a compromising of a combination of components, often distributed across workstations. In order to defend against these attacks, the GSC has hired our team to develop a methodology to characterize the faults found within the system after an attack. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivation**: Mode is a term for behavior of a system. All components in a system have behaviors associated with modes, as well as modes that are unknown to the component. Mode estimation takes in the mode, state, and observable variables and tries to determine a diagnoses for what is causing the outcome state of the system. Mode estimation is a very useful tool for characterizing what has occured in a system that could produce a given end state.  \n"

Our model will represent an input state, which is based off a set of variable assignments, and a list of conditions for a state to be a solution. These conditions will be defined by using a set of constraints on the aforementioned variables. \n",
