    "**Context**: After an important document from the Generic Space Empire (GSC) was stolen, Non-Copyrighted Alien spies began complex attacks against the prize of the GSC, the space station. These attacks are more complex than before, requiring a compromising of a combination of components, often distributed across workstations. In order to defend against these attacks, the GSC has hired our team to develop a methodology to characterize the faults found within the system after an attack. \n",

    "**Motivation**: Mode is a term for behavior of a system. All components in a system have behaviors associated with modes, as well as modes that are unknown to the component. Mode estimation takes in the mode, state, and observable variables and tries to determine a diagnoses for what is causing the outcome state of the system. Mode estimation is a very useful tool for characterizing what has occurred in a system that could produce a given end state. \n"

These conditions will be defined by using a set of constraints on the aforementioned variables. \n",

We can see that simple search (brute force) is most computationaly expensive, next is Constraint-based A* search, and best is Conflict-Directed A* Search as it uses pruning to avoid repeatedly exploring states that all won't work for the same reason, aka conflict. \n",
